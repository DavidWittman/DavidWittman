### 🎶 Who's Dave? 🎶

Hi, I'm Dave. I'm an engineer and I enjoy breaking, deploying, and maintaining software more than I enjoy writing it. You can find a smattering of my work here on Github, but most of my contributions lately have been to private repositories outside of Github.

I'm currently focused on:

  - Finding bugs and breaking things
  - Writing better tests
  - Explaining why AI won't replace people (yet)

When I'm not at a computer I'm:

  - 👨‍🍼 Parenting
  - 🐖 BBQing or 🍕 making pizza
  - 🇪🇸 Practicing Spanish
